Twitter, oAuth and some Node.js
======================

This quick app.js file should get you started in creating a twitter app with node.js and express. This is just one way of doing things, there are tons of different ways to do this with multiple plugins for node.

Note: now you could just use the oauth plugin and make all your twitter API calls with that, but I much rather use the oauth plugin to authenticate then combine it with the twit plugin for easy API calls.

Enjoy
